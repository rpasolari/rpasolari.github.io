        <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>Airfoil stall is a fundamental phenomenon in aerodynamics that occurs when the angle of attack surpasses a critical threshold. This leads to a sudden decrease in lift due to the separation of airflow from the airfoil's surface. The disrupted airflow results in increased drag and a significant loss of aerodynamic efficiency. Stall has historically contributed to numerous accidents, making it a critical area of study in aviation, where safety and performance are heavily reliant on maintaining controlled airflow over aircraft wings.</p>

            <p>In wind energy, airfoil stall plays a crucial role in the performance and efficiency of wind turbines. Stall reduces the lift generated by turbine blades, directly impacting power output. Understanding and managing stall is essential for optimizing blade design, ensuring reliable energy production, and preventing mechanical damage during high wind speeds. Additionally, "stall regulation" is often employed in wind turbines as a control strategy to limit power in extreme conditions.</p>

            <p>In research, "static stall" refers to the investigation of an airfoil under static conditions, where the angle of attack remains constant. This allows for precise measurement of the critical angle, providing valuable insights into the airfoil's aerodynamic behavior and limitations.</p>

            <h2> Project Objective</h2>
                <p>Airfoil static stall has been extensively researched in the literature. In this project, the primary goal is to validate the developed hybrid Eulerian-Lagrangian solver, VPMFoam. While this work does not introduce innovations in the field of static stall, it is crucial for enhancing the solver's credibility by testing it in a real-world, complex scenario. This validation ensures the solver can be confidently applied to broader applications.</p>

                <p>The Reynolds number used in this study is very low, at 1000. This value is well-documented in the literature, making it an ideal case for validation. The results obtained from VPMFoam are compared against these documented data to ensure accuracy and reliability.</p>

            <h2>Methodology</h2>
            <p>Here, the main aspects of the methodology used are presented. For more detailed information, please refer to the original paper: <a href="https://pubs.aip.org/aip/pof/article/36/7/077135/3303390/Eulerian-Lagrangian-hybrid-solvers-in-external" target="_blank">Eulerian–Lagrangian Hybrid Solvers in External Aerodynamics: Modeling and Analysis of Airfoil Stall</a>.</p>

            <p>The mesh used in this study is a C-shaped mesh, fully composed of hexahedra, and constructed using <a href="https://gmsh.info/" target="_blank">Gmsh</a>. It is a highly refined and narrow mesh, as the remainder of the computational domain is resolved using Vortex Particles. The Eulerian mesh is dedicated to resolving the boundary layer region and transferring this solution to the vortex particles, which then propagate the solution downstream. The image below displays the mesh, including close-ups of the leading edge, trailing edge, and the top surface of the airfoil to highlight the refinement applied.</p>

            <p>It is important to note that this mesh was selected following a detailed convergence study of both the grid and particle resolutions. The simulation parameters are listed in the table below. The time-step was determined through a time-step convergence test to ensure that the solution is not dependent on the time-step size.</p>

            <p>The simulation is conducted for angles of attack ranging from 0 to 30 degrees. The results for aerodynamic coefficients and flow fields are analyzed. The aerodynamic coefficient results are compared with three bibliographical sources. The following three images illustrate the lift coefficient (\(C_l\)) versus the angle of attack (\(\alpha\)), the drag coefficient (\(C_d\)) versus \(\alpha\), and the ratio of lift to drag coefficients (\(C_l / C_d\)) versus \(\alpha\). It is evident that the solver provides results that closely match the references. The only noticeable difference is in the prediction of the exact stall angle: our study agrees with [1] and [2], estimating the stall angle at \(25^\circ\), while [3] predicts it at \(27^\circ\). For the maximum \(C_l / C_d\), all sources concur that it occurs between \(11^\circ\) and \(12^\circ\).</p>

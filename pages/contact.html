            <p>Hi there! I’m a Mechanical Engineer with both MEng and MSc degrees from the Mechanical Engineering and Aeronautics Department at the University of Patras in Greece. These days, I’m diving deep into my PhD at the Aerospace Faculty of TU Delft in the Netherlands. My research focuses on developing a two-dimensional hybrid Eulerian-Lagrangian solver aimed at tackling external aerodynamics challenges.</p>

            <p>I’m absolutely passionate about Computational Mechanics, especially Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). From translating real-world physical problems into computational ones to pre-processing, mesh generation, solving, and post-processing—every step of the CFD workflow fascinates me.

            On top of that, I have a strong interest in software development and optimization. Whether it’s making computational mechanics run faster or creating efficient solutions for entirely different applications, I love finding smarter, faster ways to get things done.</p>

            Below, you’ll find an overview of my education, experience, skills, and certifications. Feel free to explore and get to know me better!</p>
